# Asparagus with Cranberries and Pine Nuts

This is a quick, easy way to saute asparagus. The dish has a light flavor and makes a great accompaniment to Italian meals. I make this year-round, but we especially enjoy it on Thanksgiving.

## Ingredients

- 400 g brioche loaf (or rolls)
- 150 g salted butter, melted
- 100 g soft brown sugar
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 500 ml milk
- 500 ml double cream
- 400 g dark chocolate (strong cocoa %)
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 egg yolks
- 50 ml milk
- 1 tbsp cocoa nibs (optional)
- 50 ml double cream (to drizzle)
- 12 mint leaves (garnish)

# Instructions

1. Break off or trim the woody ends from the asparagus and discard. Set the spears aside. 
2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the pine nuts, cranberries, and salt. Cook and stir until the pine nuts start to look translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add the asparagus spears and cook, adding a little more olive oil if needed, until stalks are bright green and tender, about 5 to 8 minutes. Serve on a platter with the cranberries and nuts spooned over the top of the asparagus.
